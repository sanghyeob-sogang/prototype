###  Abstract  

  
With electronic publication taking its place as the new forms of reading experience, researches combining electronic publications and audio & visual effects have been conducted. Related researches have shown that music can help enhancing the reading experience. However, web novel, the driving force for this market of electronic publication, does not fully explore this possibility mainly because of cost to produce music for each web novel. This paper introduces the new reading platform design for web novel using machine-learning generated sound. Emotion of each sentence in the text is analyzed with the sentiment analysis technology and the background music that matches the emotion is auto-generated using machine learning technology to enhance the reading experience. The experiment conducted on 29 participants in their 20s shows statistically significant results in immersion and enjoyment in the proposed one in comparison to the one without ML-generated music.
